                <p className="mb-4">
                    In 2019, the US established a directive to protect whistleblowers. This directive imposes stricter
                    requirements on employers regarding the handling of reported cases and expands the categories of
                    individuals who can report violations within a company. If you report a potential violation, you are
                    protected under the Whistleblowing Directive and relevant national legislation.
